# NOTICE!
_This version of Sofya had a lot of issues so I wanted to update it. I will release the new version in February 2026. Sorry for any inconviniences caused._

# What is Sofya?
Sofya is a **very simple programming language** (that was developed from December 2023 and released on 1st February 2026) that was named after a female mathematician called Sofya Kovalevskaya. Sofya was made by Timothy Oywera using another programming language called **Python**. Sofya was made to enable people to program computers to solve **mathematical** and **scientific problems** in a very simple way.

# Why use Sofya?
The answer is quite simple, **_Sofya is simpler than most of the other programming languages out there today_**. To demonstrate this, let us say that we want to make a simple program that _asks the computer user to enter two numbers then the computer should calculate the sum and difference of the two numbers_. We can compare how this program looks in **C**, **Python** and **Sofya**.

# _The C Program_
1.    #include <stdio.h>
2.    int main()
3.    {
4.      int x, y, sum, difference;
5.      printf("Input two numbers:\n");
6.      scanf("%i %i", &x, &y);
7.      sum = x + y;
8.      difference = x - y;
9.      printf("The sum is %i and the difference is %i", sum, difference);
10.     return 0;
11.    }

# _The Python Program_
1.   x = int(input("Input the first number: "))
2.   y = int(input("Input the second number: "))
3.   sum = x + y
4.   difference = x - y
5.   print(f"The sum is {sum} and the difference is {difference}")
  
# _The Sofya Program_
1.   Start this program
2.     Ask the computer user "Input the first number" and store the answer in Variable[x]
3.     Ask the computer user "Input the second number" and store the answer in Variable[y]
4.     Variable Sum is Variable[x] + Variable[y]
5.     Variable Difference is Variable[x] - Variable[y]
6.     Write "The sum is" and also write Variable[Sum] on the screen
7.     Write "The difference is" and also write Variable[Difference] on the screen
8.   Stop this program
  
# How to Set Up Sofya Version 1.0
1. Clone (Download) this repository.
2. If you cloned the Sofya Version 1.0 repository (in step 1), you should find it in the downloads section on your computer (it will be in a folder named **Sofya-Version-1.0-main**). You can **unzip** (extract the files from) this folder by right clicking on it then choosing the option for **extracting** the files.
3. The computer will ask you where you want to extract the files to. Choose the place where you want the computer to extract the files to.
4. Then go to the place where the computer extracted the files to and you will find a folder called **Sofya-Version-1.0-main**.
5. If you click on this folder, you will see three other folders called **Sofya Version 1.0 Documentation**, **Sofya Version 1.0 for Windows** and **Sofya Version 1.0 for MacOS**. The Sofya Version 1.0 Documentation folder has the **manual**, the **README** and the **licence** for Sofya. The Sofya Version 1.0 for Windows folder has the **Sofya Version 1.0 IDLE** _(that can only work if you are using Windows Operating System)_. Lastly, the Sofya Version 1.0 for MacOS folder has the **Sofya Version 1.0 IDLE** _(that can only work if you are using Macintosh Operating System)_. **_Note: The Sofya Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) is a place where you can write Sofya programs_**.

# Important Notes
1. Sofya is **NOT** a case sensitive language.
2. Sofya is designed for people who are beginners in programming, so it is very simple to use.
