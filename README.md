# NOTICE!
_This version of Sofya had a lot of issues so I wanted to update it. I will release the new version in January 2026. Sorry for any inconviniences caused._

# What is Sofya?
Sofya is a very simple programming language (that was developed from December 2023 and released on 7th October 2025) that was named after a female mathematician called Sofya Kovalevskaya. Sofya was made by Timothy Oywera using another programming language called Python. Sofya was made to enable people to program computers to solve mathematical and scientific problems in a very simple way.

# Why use Sofya?
The answer is quite simple, _Sofya is simpler than most of the other programming languages out there today_. To demonstrate this, let us say that we want to make a simple program that asks the computer user to enter two numbers then the computer should calculate the sum and difference of the two numbers. We can compare how this program looks in _C_, _Python_ and _Sofya_.

# _The C Program_
1.    #include <stdio.h>
2.    int main()
3.    {
4.      int x, y, sum, difference;
5.      printf("Input two numbers:\n");
6.      scanf("%i %i", &x, &y);
7.      sum = x + y;
8.      difference = x - y;
9.      printf("The sum is %i and the difference is %i", sum, difference);
10.     return 0;
11.    }

# _The Python Program_
1.   x = int(input("Input the first number: "))
2.   y = int(input("Input the second number: "))
3.   sum = x + y
4.   difference = x - y
5.   print(f"The sum is {sum} and the difference is {difference}")
  
# _The Sofya Program_
1.   Start
2.     Ask Computer User "Input the first number:" and store the answer in Variable[x]
3.     Ask Computer User "Input the second number:" and store the answer in Variable[y]
4.     Variable Sum is Variable[x] + Variable[y]
5.     Variable Difference is Variable[x] - Variable[y]
6.     Write "The sum is" and also write Variable[Sum]
7.     Write "The difference is" and also write Variable[Difference]
8.   Stop
  
# How to Set Up Sofya Version 1.0
1. If you do not have Python, you will need to download the latest version of Python (because Sofya was made using Python). You can access the Python website through this link to download the basic Python IDLE: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If you do not want to use the **basic Python IDLE**, you can use an advanced IDE like **PyCharm** or **Visual Studio Code**.
3. If you cloned the Sofya Version 1.0 repository (in step 1), you should find it in the downloads section on your computer (it will be in a folder named **Sofya-Version-1.0-main**)  In the Sofya Version 1.0 repository, you will find a Python file named **Sofya Version 1.0 IDLE**. Use the basic Python IDLE (that you downloaded in step 2) or an advanced IDE like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code to open this file.
4. If you run this file, the **Sofya Version 1.0 IDLE** will appear on the screen.
5. If you have managed to do all this, you have successfully set up Sofya Version 1.0! You can now refer to the Sofya 1.0 User Manual to start using Sofya.

# Important Notes
1. Sofya is **NOT** a case sensitive language.
2. Sofya is designed for people who are beginners in programming, so it is very simple to use.
